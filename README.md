# Flink Tutorials

## Introduction

https://github.com/luweizheng/flink-tutorials

This is a Flink(v1.11) tutorial repo. I will update to latest Flink version in the future.

You can clone it and learn some basic ideas about Flink. I use Java and Scala to demonstrate how to use Flink. You need to install Intellij Idea and Maven in your local environment.

**Please star this repo** if you find it useful.

I also wrote a book (in Chinese) about Flink.
